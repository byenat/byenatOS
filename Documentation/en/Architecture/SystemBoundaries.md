# ByenatOS System Boundary Definition

## Core Principle: Operating System vs Applications

### üîµ ByenatOS Responsibilities (Operating System Layer)

#### 1. Core System Services
- **Kernel** - Process management, memory management, device drivers
- **SystemServices** - File system, network stack, authentication services
- **Hardware** - Hardware abstraction layer and device management

#### 2. AI Infrastructure Services
- **LocalHiNATAProcessor** - HiNATA data refinement and PSP generation
- **PersonalizationEngine** - PSP management and storage
- **ApplicationFramework** - Provides development framework and APIs for Apps

#### 3. Data Processing Pipeline
```
HiNATA Data Reception ‚Üí Local Model Processing ‚Üí PSP Generation ‚Üí PSP Storage ‚Üí API Provision to Apps
```

### üü¢ Application Responsibilities (App Layer)

#### 1. User Interaction Interface
- **Chat Interface** - ChatBox App
- **Notes Interface** - Notes App  
- **Reading Interface** - ReadItLater App
- **Task Management** - Todo App

#### 2. Business Logic Processing
- **Content Generation** - Call online large models
- **User Conversation** - Process user input and responses
- **Data Display** - Visualize user data
- **Functional Operations** - Specific business function implementation

#### 3. AI Model Invocation
```
User Input ‚Üí App Processing ‚Üí Call Online Large Model (with PSP) ‚Üí Personalized Response ‚Üí User Interface Display
```

## Clear System Division of Labor

### What Does ByenatOS Provide?

1. **Stable System Kernel**
   - Process scheduling, memory management
   - File system, network services
   - Device drivers and hardware abstraction

2. **AI Data Processing Services**
   - Receive HiNATA data from Apps
   - Local model processing and analysis
   - Generate and manage PSP
   - Provide PSP to Apps via API

3. **Application Development Framework**
   - Unified App development SDK
   - HiNATA data format specification
   - PSP invocation API
   - System service interfaces

### What Does ByenatOS NOT Provide?

‚ùå **Direct User Interaction**
   - Does not provide chat interface
   - Does not process user conversations
   - Does not generate user content

‚ùå **Application Functions**
   - Is not a chatbot
   - Is not a notes application
   - Is not a reading tool

‚ùå **Online AI Calls**
   - Does not directly call GPT, Claude, etc.
   - Does not process user AI requests
   - Does not manage online models

## Correct Interaction Flow

### User Flow Using ChatBox App:

```
1. User enters a question in ChatBox App
   ‚Üì
2. ChatBox App calls byenatOS API to get user's PSP
   ‚Üì  
3. ChatBox App sends user question + PSP to online large model (e.g., GPT-4)
   ‚Üì
4. Online large model generates personalized response based on PSP
   ‚Üì
5. ChatBox App displays response to user
   ‚Üì
6. User's conversation record generates HiNATA data
   ‚Üì
7. ChatBox App sends HiNATA data to byenatOS
   ‚Üì
8. byenatOS's local model processes HiNATA, updates PSP
```
