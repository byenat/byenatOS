# ByenatOS Local Model Architecture - Focused on HiNATA to PSP Conversion

## Architecture Overview

ByenatOS's local model adopts a **specialized design**, similar to a dedicated "data processing chip", focusing on two core functions:

1. **HiNATA Content Refinement Processing** - Intelligently analyze and refine user's raw data
2. **HiNATA to PSP Conversion** - Convert processed data into personalized system prompts

**Important Design Principle**: Local models do not handle any other AI interaction scenarios. All user conversations, content generation, Q&A, etc. are handled by online large models.

**Location**: `Kernel/Core/LocalHiNATAProcessor.py`

```python
class LocalHiNATAProcessor:
    """Local HiNATA Processor - Specialized for data refinement and PSP generation"""
    
    async def RefineHiNATAContent(hinata_record) -> RefinedHiNATA:
        """Refine HiNATA content - Core function 1"""
